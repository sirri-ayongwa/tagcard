# TagCard 🏷️

**Skip the small talk. Share who you really are.**

TagCard is a minimal, privacy-first digital profile card app. It was born from a simple idea: dating (and meeting new people in general) shouldn't start with the same repetitive questions every time. With TagCard, you create a profile with your bio, likes, dislikes, and social links — then share it instantly via a scannable QR code or a downloadable business card PDF.

No swiping. No awkward icebreakers. Just your story, your tags, and a real conversation starter.
